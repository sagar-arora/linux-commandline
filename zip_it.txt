zip [options] zipfile files_list

zipfile: the name you want to give your zip after zipping.

I like the following options:

I always add the file I am not supposed to add. So, I remove it using the particular file from the zip 
using -d option.

$zip -d zipfile file1.txt

$zip â€“u filename.zip file.txt



$unzip zipfile

-d /path/to/extact/location: Unzip an archive to a different directory.

-x filename: Extract the archive but do not extract the specified files.
